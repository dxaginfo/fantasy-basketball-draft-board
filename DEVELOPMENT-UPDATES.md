# Fantasy Basketball Draft Assistant - Development Updates

## June 18, 2025 - Core State Management Implementation

### Overview
Today's development focused on establishing the Redux state management architecture for the Fantasy Basketball Draft Assistant application. The implemented features provide a solid foundation for the application's data flow and state management.

### Implemented Features

#### Core State Management
- **TypeScript Type Definitions**: Created comprehensive type system covering:
  - Player data structures
  - Draft management interfaces
  - UI state definitions
  - Team analysis models
  - Authentication types

- **Redux Store Implementation**:
  - Configured Redux Toolkit store with middleware
  - Set up Redux Persist for state persistence
  - Implemented modular slice architecture

#### Auth Slice
- Created authentication slice with:
  - Login/register functionality
  - JWT token management
  - User session persistence
  - Error handling

#### UI Slice
- Implemented UI state management for:
  - Dark/light mode toggle
  - Responsive design detection
  - Filter configurations
  - Sort preferences
  - Modal management

#### Mock Draft Slice
- Developed simulation capabilities:
  - Draft simulation controls (pause/play/speed)
  - AI strategy framework
  - Mock draft pick generation
  - Draft progress tracking

#### Type System Design
The application uses a comprehensive TypeScript type system to ensure data consistency across components, with key interfaces for:
- Player data and statistics
- Draft settings and configuration
- Team analysis and visualization
- User authentication and profiles

### Next Steps
